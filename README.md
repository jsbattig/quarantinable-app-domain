# quarantinable-app-domain
This library provides basic building block to create a "quarantinable" AppDomain that will be unloaded upon certain exceptions thrown

This library depends on CNeptune and NConcern nuget packages to operate. CNeptune should be applied to libraries where wrapper classes that are intended to be monitored reside.
